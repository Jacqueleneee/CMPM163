CMPM163 - HOMEWORK 2

In this homework packet, we learned to render a scene with ray tracing or signed distance functions. We referenced ShaderToy and manipulated geometries such as bending or twisting as well as formed shapes with unions and subtractions. Everything was implemented in the fragment shader. A PDF is attached that also lays out the group project - my topic is cloud simulation

Part B - Signed distance functions

Part C - Group Project
