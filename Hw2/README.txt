CMPM163 - HOMEWORK 2

In this homework packet, we experimented with bodies of water, reflection, sky maps, noise functions, height maps, and GPU particle systems. We were to create an abstract that shows our understanding of these concepts.

Part A - I used a sky map wrapped around a cube to create a sky box. I implemented a body of water using a water normal texture (Three JS water library). Underneath the water is a height map that is used to resemble terrain under the water.

Part B - I used a GPU particle system and noise functions covered in class. The green particles circle around the sphere and represent an abstract scene.
